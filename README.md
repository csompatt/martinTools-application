### Items tools list:
```
Item 1:       Item 2:       Item 3:

Nr. 1         Nr. 5         Nr. 4
Nr. 2         Nr. 6         Nr. 5
Nr. 3         Nr. 7         Nr. 8
Nr. 4         Nr. 8         Nr. 9
Nr. 5         Nr. 9         Nr. 10
                            Nr. 11
                            Nr. 12
```
```
If I finished every piece of an item, 
I must to take out the unnecessarily tools and put into the machine the tools for the new item.

The new item is Item 4:

Nr. 1      
Nr. 13
Nr. 14
Nr. 15
```
### After finished items:

```
We suppose I finished every piece from the item 1 and I must to take out the tools, which I don't need to the other items.

Before my application I must to open every program, and search every tools to know which is neccessary.
With my application we have only one task to do, add the item numbers and click on the button and we have the result which tools could we take out.
```

In our example we can take out the tools Nr. 2 and Nr. 3.
